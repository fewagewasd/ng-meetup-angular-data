# Angular Data @AngularJS Meetup Vienna

This is the source code for my Angular-Data talk at the AngularJS Meetup in Vienna (Jan 12th, 2015).

## Prerequisites

* Java 8
* Maven

## How to Run

To build and run the project execute the following command:

    mvn spring-boot:run

This will start up the server on http://localhost:8080/index.html (where you can choose between the $http and angular-data versions)
